2048
====

This is a WIP AI that uses machine learning to play the game 2048.  
Original game code made by jvaelen: https://github.com/jvaelen/2048  
  
My first initial experience and research regarding machine learning  
was by watching a 4 part explanation of a youtube channel called '3Blue1Brown'.
